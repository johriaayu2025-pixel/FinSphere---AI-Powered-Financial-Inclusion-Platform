🌍 Problem Statement

Over 13 billion people in emerging markets still lack access to formal financial systems.
Traditional banking relies heavily on credit scores, salary slips, and documents, leaving out freelancers, gig workers, students, farmers, and small business owners.

FinSphere bridges this gap by using AI and non-traditional data to assess creditworthiness, promote financial literacy, and provide smart, personalized financial guidance.

UPI & payment patterns

SMS metadata and transaction messages

Online spending and bill payment behavior

Device usage trends

✅ Output: Predicts creditworthiness using an ML model and visualizes user credit health through interactive charts.

🔹 2. AI Financial Mentor (Chatbot)

A multilingual AI chatbot (English + Hindi) that acts as a personal financial guide.
Users can ask:

“How do I improve my credit score?”
“Where can I invest ₹5000 safely?”

The chatbot provides personalized financial tips and spending insights.
