Theme: AI-Powered Financial Inclusion & Intelligent Credit Ecosystem for the Next Billion Users

üåç Overview

FinSphere is an end-to-end AI-powered fintech platform designed to promote financial inclusion for freelancers, students, farmers, and gig workers who are often excluded by traditional banking systems.

It uses alternative data, AI/ML models, and explainable insights to build trust, offer fair credit access, and empower financial literacy for the next billion users.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Modules
1Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Credit Scoring Engine

Uses non-traditional data (UPI patterns, spending behavior, mobile usage) to estimate creditworthiness.

Integrates pretrained models (DistilBERT, BERT-base-uncased) fine-tuned on:

Financial PhraseBank

Credit Risk Dataset (Kaggle)

Provides Explainable AI (XAI) output ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy this person got this score?‚Äù

2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Personal Finance Dashboard

Tracks income, expenses, and savings

Generates AI-driven insights and dynamic ‚ÄúFinancial Health Index‚Äù

Shows graphs, recommendations, and personalized advice

Allows users to input:

Mood/stress levels

Spending habits

Savings goals
‚Üí Updates insights dynamically

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Financial Mentor / Chatbot

Acts as a personal finance guide in local languages

Explains loans, EMIs, and investment options

Lightweight design supports offline/rural use cases

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fraud Detection & Risk Intelligence

Detects fake KYCs, money laundering, or suspicious spending

Optionally integrates OpenAI or Gemini API for text-based fraud detection (‚ÄúIs this SMS or message fraudulent?‚Äù)

Displays real-time static alerts or anomaly cards in dashboard

5Ô∏è‚É£ SaaS API Layer (Open Banking)

Your platform also acts as a service layer (API) that banks or NBFCs can plug into:

üîó Endpoint:
https://hywuddqzrlcvbxvurpoh.supabase.co/functions/v1/finance-insights

üß© Example Request (Test in Console or ReqBin):
fetch('https://hywuddqzrlcvbxvurpoh.supabase.co/functions/v1/finance-insights', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: 'demo-user-123' })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))

‚úÖ Example Response:
{
  "user_id": "demo-user-123",
  "risk_score": 0.86,
  "financial_wellness_summary": "Strong credit behavior detected",
  "analysis": {
    "spending_trend": "stable",
    "savings_rate": "healthy",
    "credit_utilization": "optimal",
    "bill_payment_history": "excellent"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Continue maintaining current spending patterns",
    "Consider increasing emergency fund by 10%",
    "Optimize credit card usage for better rewards"
  ]
}


This proves real-world scalability and B2B potential for integration.
